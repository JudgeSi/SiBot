### User story

As a user I want to be able to use the contents of my clip board to be properly inserted into the chat window. Right now a line break in my clip board content will be interpreted as an enter terminating signal for the user inpu

Investigation using chat gpt:

The program reads the user input from the console. The issue is that this does not properly work with copy pasted input that contains multiple lines. Why is that?
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

The issue is related to the way the program reads user input. It uses `reader.next().unwrap()?;` to read input line by line from the console. When you copy and paste multi-line input, the program reads only the first line of the input and ignores the rest.

To fix this issue, you can modify the input reading part of the code to handle multi-line input. For example, you can read input until a specific delimiter or an empty line is encountered. Here's one way to do it:

```rust
let mut input = String::new();
loop {
    let line = reader.next().unwrap()?;
    if line.trim().is_empty() {
        break;
    }
    input.push_str(&line);
    input.push('\n');
}
```

This code will read lines until it encounters an empty line, at which point it will stop reading and proceed with the collected input.

You:
That would mean though that if the copy pasted input contains two empty lines this would still be interpreted as a user input?
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

Yes, you are correct. The provided solution would interpret two consecutive empty lines as the end of the user input. If you need a more robust way to handle multi-line input, you could use a specific delimiter or a sentinel string that is unlikely to appear in the input. For example, you could use a string like `---END---` as the delimiter. Here's how you can modify the code to handle this:

```rust
let mut input = String::new();
loop {
    let line = reader.next().unwrap()?;
    if line.trim() == "---END---" {
        break;
    }
    input.push_str(&line);
    input.push('\n');
}
```

Now, the user can paste multi-line input containing empty lines, and the program will continue reading until it encounters the `---END---` delimiter.

You:
is there a way to recognize copy pasted input and wrap it in some way so that any copy pasted text is always recognized as one single block?
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

Detecting copy-pasted input automatically is challenging because it depends on the behavior of the terminal or console used. Most terminals or consoles don't provide any specific indication that input is copy-pasted. However, you can use a workaround to handle multi-line input more effectively.

One approach is to use a timeout-based method to detect when a user has stopped pasting input. You can read input character by character, and if there's a significant delay between characters, assume that the user has finished pasting. This method isn't foolproof but can work reasonably well in many cases.

Here's an example using the `tokio` crate and its `timeout` function:

```rust
use tokio::time::{self, Duration};

async fn read_user_input() -> Result<String> {
    let mut input = String::new();
    let mut buffer = [0; 1];
    let stdin = io::stdin();

    loop {
        match time::timeout(Duration::from_millis(100), stdin.read_exact(&mut buffer)).await {
            Ok(_) => {
                let ch = buffer[0] as char;
                if ch == '\n' {
                    break;
                }
                input.push(ch);
            }
            Err(_) => {
                if !input.is_empty() {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(input)
}
```

In this example, we read input character by character and use a timeout of 100 milliseconds. If there's no input within this time, we assume the user has finished pasting and break the loop. You can adjust the timeout duration to better suit your specific use case.

To use this function in your main loop, replace the line `let input = reader.next().unwrap()?;` with `let input = read_user_input().await?;`. Note that this approach might not work well when users type slowly or when there are delays in the terminal or console.

You:
Browsers often time also have chat windows, where one can paste any kind of input that has multiple line breaks. When clicking enter though in a browser chat window the chat will still be submitted. How is my problem solved in a browser?
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

In a browser-based chat window, handling multi-line input is typically managed by using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chat input area is often created using an HTML `<textarea>` element, which allows users to enter multi-line text. When the user presses the Enter key, JavaScript captures the event and submits the entire content of the `<textarea>` as a single message, regardless of the number of line breaks.

Here's a simple example of how this can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Chat Example</title>
    <style>
        #chat-input {
            width: 100%;
            height: 100px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <textarea id="chat-input" placeholder="Type your message here..."></textarea>
    <button id="send-btn">Send</button>

    <script>
        const chatInput = document.getElementById('chat-input');
        const sendBtn = document.getElementById('send-btn');

        sendBtn.addEventListener('click', sendMessage);

        chatInput.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
            if (event.key === 'Enter' && !event.shiftKey) {
                event.preventDefault();
                sendMessage();
            }
        });

        function sendMessage() {
            const message = chatInput.value.trim();
            if (message) {
                console.log('Message:', message);
                chatInput.value = '';
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a `<textarea>` for chat input and a "Send" button. We add event listeners to both the button and the `<textarea>`. When the Enter key is pressed without the Shift key, the `sendMessage` function is called, which takes the entire content of the `<textarea>` and processes it as a single message. The Shift+Enter combination allows users to insert line breaks within the `<textarea>` without submitting the message.

You:
I do not want to use any javascript or any browser. Looking how this problem is solved in the browser, can this be trasferred to my problem of separating copy pasted input in the console correctly?
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

Unfortunately, the solution used in browsers cannot be directly transferred to console applications, because browsers and console applications have different input handling mechanisms. In a browser, you can use HTML and JavaScript to create an input field that accepts and processes multi-line input as a single block. In a console application, input is typically read line by line or character by character, which makes handling multi-line input more challenging.

However, you can implement a workaround in your console application to handle multi-line input more effectively. One approach is to ask the user to input a specific delimiter or sentinel string to indicate the end of their input. This way, the user can paste multi-line input, and the program will continue reading until it encounters the specified delimiter.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to handle multi-line input using a delimiter:

```rust
println!("Please enter your input. When finished, type '---END---' on a new line and press Enter.");

let mut input = String::new();
loop {
    let line = reader.next().unwrap()?;
    if line.trim() == "---END---" {
        break;
    }
    input.push_str(&line);
    input.push('\n');
}
```

Now, the user can paste multi-line input containing empty lines, and the program will continue reading until it encounters the `---END---` delimiter. This approach is not as seamless as the browser-based solution, but it provides a way to handle multi-line input in a console application.
---
You:
Would it be possible to only stop reading input from the console once a user clicks shift+enter?
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

In a console application, detecting a combination like Shift+Enter is not straightforward because the console usually doesn't provide raw keyboard events. However, you can achieve similar functionality using a different key combination that can be detected in the console. For example, you can use Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z on Windows) to signal the end of input.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to handle multi-line input using Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z on Windows) as the end-of-input signal:

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

println!("Please enter your input. When finished, press Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z on Windows) and then press Enter.");

let mut input = String::new();
let mut buffer = [0; 1];
let stdin = io::stdin();

loop {
    let bytes_read = stdin.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    if bytes_read == 0 {
        break;
    }
    input.push(buffer[0] as char);
}
```

This code reads input character by character and stops reading when it detects the end-of-file (EOF) signal, which is triggered by pressing Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z on Windows). Note that the user still needs to press Enter after the Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z) to submit the input.

Keep in mind that this approach may not work consistently across all platforms and terminals. The behavior of the console input and the interpretation of special key combinations like Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z can vary depending on the operating system, terminal emulator, or shell being used.

You:
can the console read the clipboard? so that I could write an explicit command like 'copy_clipboard' into the console and the console would than access the current clipboard and use its content?
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

Yes, you can read the clipboard content in a console application using an external crate like `clipboard`. This crate provides cross-platform support for clipboard operations. You can use the `ClipboardProvider` trait to access the clipboard content.

To use the `clipboard` crate, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
clipboard = "0.5"
```

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to read the clipboard content when the user types "copy_clipboard":

```rust
use clipboard::ClipboardProvider;
use clipboard::ClipboardContext;

// ...

loop {
    // wait for user input.
    println!("You: ");
    io::stdout().flush()?;
    let input = reader.next().unwrap()?;
    let input = input.trim();
    if input.is_empty() {
        continue;
    }

    let mut processed_input = input.to_string();
    if input == "copy_clipboard" {
        let mut ctx: ClipboardContext = ClipboardProvider::new().unwrap();
        match ctx.get_contents() {
            Ok(contents) => {
                println!("Clipboard content:\n{}", contents);
                processed_input = contents;
            }
            Err(e) => {
                println!("Failed to read clipboard: {}", e);
            }
        }
    }

    // Use `processed_input` instead of `input` in the rest of the loop
    // ...
}
```

In this example, when the user types "copy_clipboard", the program reads the clipboard content and stores it in the `processed_input` variable. You can then use this variable in the rest of the loop.

Keep in mind that accessing the clipboard might require additional permissions or dependencies on some platforms. Be sure to test your application on your target platforms to ensure compatibility.

You:
Is it possible to easily use two different modes in my console application? Im thinking of the two modes in vim for instance, where you have a insert mode and a navigation mode. This way I could easily create a different sentinel character (key combination) to know when to break the input
 ---
GPT-4-8k:

Yes, you can implement multiple modes in your console application, similar to Vim's insert and navigation modes. One way to achieve this is by using a state machine to manage the different modes and their behaviors.

Here's an example of how you can implement a simple console application with two modes: "input" and "command":

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead, Write};

enum AppState {
    InputMode,
    CommandMode,
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut reader = stdin.lock().lines();

    let mut state = AppState::CommandMode;

    loop {
        match state {
            AppState::InputMode => {
                print!("Input Mode > ");
                io::stdout().flush().unwrap();

                let mut input = String::new();
                loop {
                    let line = reader.next().unwrap().unwrap();
                    if line.trim() == "---END---" {
                        break;
                    }
                    input.push_str(&line);
                    input.push('\n');
                }

                println!("Received input:\n{}", input);
                state = AppState::CommandMode;
            }
            AppState::CommandMode => {
                print!("Command Mode > ");
                io::stdout().flush().unwrap();

                let command = reader.next().unwrap().unwrap();
                match command.trim() {
                    "input" => {
                        state = AppState::InputMode;
                    }
                    "exit" => {
                        break;
                    }
                    _ => {
                        println!("Unknown command: {}", command);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we define an `AppState` enum to represent the different modes. The main loop switches between modes based on the current state. In "input" mode, the program reads multi-line input until it encounters the `---END---` delimiter. In "command" mode, the program accepts single-line commands to switch between modes or exit the application.

You can extend this example to add more modes or customize the behavior of each mode as needed. Note that this example doesn't provide the same level of interactivity as Vim, as it still relies on line-based input. Implementing more advanced interaction, like real-time key press handling, would require using a library like `crossterm` or `termion` to manage terminal input and output.
